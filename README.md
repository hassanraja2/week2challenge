<h1 What was the challenge? </h1>

The challenge was to create two containers, one for flask-application and the other one for mysql. The aim of the challenge was to build images and containers and successfully deploying them to their relevant ports. 

How I expected the challenge to go?

At first I thought the challenge will be tough as I overthinked a lot, but when I read the descroption properly, I understood the challenge more clearly./ 

What went well?

I managed to complete the challenge successfully with the help of demi vedeos and the practice that I had with building images and containers. All the knowledge and skills definately playes a huge role for completing this challenge. 

What didn't go as planned?

I was able to complete the challenge successfully but I had issues with uploading it to github. Nonetheless, practice with github makes it perfect. 

Possible improvements for future challenges?

I believe that I have learned a wide range of technologies since last week, and I aim to practise them in my free time so that I become comfortable in using them.
